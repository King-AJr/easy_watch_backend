want to hear evil men don't like when their women are not dependent on them they would rather do everything for the woman while she just lays around and I am not about that life first of all evil men like to take care of their women they don't like their women to stress they want to spoil their woman they want to pamper their woman they like to treat their women as a queen is supposed to be treated what if it's the stress I like I mean don't get me wrong I love the attention the spoiling and pampering for once in my life but the hustle drives me TR what you look very beautiful when you
